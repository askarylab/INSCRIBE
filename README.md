## INSCRIBE, a scalable approach to in situ readout the single cell signaling history at the endpoint

Analysis resources for the manuscript under review, titled as "Genetic recording and in situ readout of single cell signaling histories", a modified version of the preprint "Reconstructing signaling history of single cells with imaging-based molecular recording", available here https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.10.11.617908v1

All custom scripts wrote in Python Jupyter Notebook and processed data required to replicate our analysis are provided here, which organized as "Analysis" and "Processed data" folder.

The subfolder structure is organized as the annotation of Figures same as the manuscript under review. The "Analysis" fould is included the experimental conditions files and the Jupyter Notebooks to replicated the results. The "Processed data" folder is included the output data from our data processing pipeline, two demostration of which is included in the "Demo" folder.

In the "Demo" folder is included two analysis pipline, Amplicon Sequencing and Ratiometric barcode readout, including detailed Jupyter Notebooks and datasets used for demostration.
The INSCRIBE barcode array amplicon sequencing raw datasets are deposited into the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)â€™s Sequence Read Archive, accession number PRJNA1232380. The ratiometric barcode readout raw data demo and all the other imaging raw data are available upon request from the corresponding author, considering the huge size of data storage.
